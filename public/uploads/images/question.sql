Appetina has a wellknown track record of supplying mouthwatering food at reasonable prices. Moffing hopes that this will increase enthusiasm about one of the major perks it offers staff. Human Resources director Akari Tanaka explains, &ldquo;The staff survey we conducted showed that people were tired of the lack of options and the same dishes being offered</p>\n			</td>\n			<td>by our old provider. Appetina draws on a wide range of cuisines for its menus, from Indian to Greek to Brazilian. The dishes are made of fresh, healthy ingredients. Plus they&rsquo;re all delicious.&rdquo; Despite the upgrade, Ms. Tanaka says that the cost of cafeteria fare will not go up, thanks to an adjustment to the company meal subsidy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll still be able to get a satisfying meal for $5,&rdquo; she promises. Employees can try out Appetina&rsquo;s offerings starting from October 1. Please note that the cafeteria will be closed during the last week of September to facilitate the changeover</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n');
